825,Australia,"The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth.

The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes.

3958,Australia,"With only 12% new oak and 28% of the fruit coming from the cool Eden Valley, this wine may hold more appeal to lovers of Old World Syrah than any other Torbreck bottling.

Given the quality of this wine, it's a shame that Wynns' high-end john Riddoch Cab doesn't get exported to the U.S.",Black Label,90,40,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wynns Coonawarra Estate

10602,Australia,"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length.

10633,Australia,"There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.",Are You Game?,84,17,Victoria,Victoria,,Pinot Noir,Fowles Wine
10771,Australia,"The fruit for this offering comes from the Green's and Crowhurst vineyards. This wine brings a a sense of cellarworthiness, from the inky color and dense, impenetrable bouquet to the richly tannic palate and long, plushly textured finish. Right now, it delivers hints of toast and mint, blueberry and plum fruit and savory notes of roasted meat and mocha.

10793,Australia,"Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, yet with great focus and length, ending crisply despite the wine's inherent richness. Drink now???2020, perhaps longer.",Art Series,94,89,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Leeuwin Estate
10865,Australia,"Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness. The finish lingers, with a supple, dreamy character that speaks to a gentle climate and careful winemaking. Drink now???2030.",,95,84,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moss Wood

It's full bodied and firm, with a long, finely textured finish. Drink now???2025.",Eligo,94,100,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,John Duval Wines
11074,Australia,"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017???2030, and perhaps beyond.",St. Henri,94,65,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
11098,Australia,"These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines.

11185,Australia,"A tip of the cap to the Angove family for turning out such an ageworthy wine. It's packed and stacked with mulberry fruit, lashings of vanilla and just a hint of mint.

11386,Australia,"It's not often you find mature, ready-to-drink Shiraz like this newly released in the U.S. From extended time in oak, this has some mossy, vanilla shadings on the nose that ease gently into savory, meaty notes and dried plum flavors. Hints of brown sugar, chocolate and mint linger on the supple finish. Drink now and over the next few years.",Reserve,93,42,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,3 Rings
11398,Australia,"From vines planted in 1893, this is an inky, concentrated Shiraz. The aromas hint at cracked pepper, vanilla and blueberries, while on the palate, this is superripe and full bodied.

11546,Australia,"This juicy, medium-bodied Shiraz is filled with mouthwatering cherry-berry fruit.

Drink now???2020.",The Lodge Hill,90,20,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Jim Barry
11549,Australia,"Interestingly, I preferred this winery's entry-level Cabernet (Blacksmith) to this one. The 2014 Jackaman is so supple and easy to drink that it lacks a bit of the Cabernet austerity that makes the variety so attractive with red meats. Vanilla, dill and cassis notes finish softly dusty. This is very smooth and polished in texture, maybe too much so for me.",Jackaman's,90,69,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Langmeil

11678,Australia,"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030.",St. Henri,93,99,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
11692,Australia,"Blended from Clare Valley, Mount Benson and Adelaide Plains fruit, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that's complex and structured.

11694,Australia,"After spending 20 months in a mix of French and American oak, this full-bodied Shiraz is imbued with seductive notes of vanilla and baking spices.

11805,Australia,"Silky and plush, this textural harmony is one of the characters that define Margaret River Cabernets.

12076,Australia,"How to virtually guarantee a luxury wine will be undervalued? Put it out under mass-market branding. If a wine this quality were marketed as boutique, it would likely sell for much more, as it's a terrific example of old-vine Barossa Valley Shiraz.

12757,Australia,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates.

15051,Australia,"Winemaker Peter Howland is making a name for himself by sourcing grapes from all over Australia. From his home base in the Hunter Valley, this Chardonnay deftly balances oaky notes of allspice and brown sugar with elements of Asian pear, melon and citrus.

28731,Australia,"In the context of 2010, I have to admit to some disappointment with how this wine is showing. It's still an excellent wine, filled with luscious oak and bold fruit. But the fruit is slightly stewed, the tannins slightly coarse and the wine's structure a bit open knit. At least in this vintage, it seems more short-term drinker than true collectible.",G.A.M.,90,55,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo

28831,Australia,"The fruit for this offering comes from the Green's and Crowhurst vineyards. This wine brings a a sense of cellarworthiness, from the inky color and dense, impenetrable bouquet to the richly tannic palate and long, plushly textured finish. Right now, it delivers hints of toast and mint, blueberry and plum fruit and savory notes of roasted meat and mocha. Drink 2018???2025+.",R Reserve,95,105,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
28853,Australia,"Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, yet with great focus and length, ending crisply despite the wine's inherent richness. Drink now???2020, perhaps longer.",Art Series,94,89,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Leeuwin Estate
29103,Australia,"Eligo is winemaker John Duval's luxury Shiraz, drawn from selected Barossa parcels. The 2009 is a dark, tarry Shiraz, heavy on the savory elements of black olives and dark chocolate and buttressed by ample cassis-tinged fruit.

29104,Australia,"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017???2030, and perhaps beyond.",St. Henri,94,65,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
29128,Australia,"These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines.

It's intense and invigorating, with a burst of fresh citrus echoing on the finish.",The Lucky Lizard,90,22,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Chardonnay,D'Arenberg
29319,Australia,"This is textbook Clare Valley dry Riesling, with lime sherbet aromas and flavors that come across as slightly one-dimensional at this young age.

Drink now???2025.",St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release,90,40,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Wakefield Estate

29334,Australia,"This is slightly bigger and bolder than the 2009 Art Series Cabernet, but remains a relatively streamlined and silky rendering of the variety.

29476,Australia,"It's not often you find mature, ready-to-drink Shiraz like this newly released in the U.S. From extended time in oak, this has some mossy, vanilla shadings on the nose that ease gently into savory, meaty notes and dried plum flavors.

29488,Australia,"From vines planted in 1893, this is an inky, concentrated Shiraz. The aromas hint at cracked pepper, vanilla and blueberries, while on the palate, this is superripe and full bodied.

29768,Australia,"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030.",St. Henri,93,99,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
29782,Australia,"Blended from Clare Valley, Mount Benson and Adelaide Plains fruit, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that's complex and structured.

29784,Australia,"After spending 20 months in a mix of French and American oak, this full-bodied Shiraz is imbued with seductive notes of vanilla and baking spices. But there are also plenty of plummy fruit and savory undertones of espresso and roasted meat. It's supple enough to drink now, although it should last through at least 2025.",RSW,92,60,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Wirra Wirra
30015,Australia,"Based in Clare Valley, Wakefield sources this fruit from the cooler Adelaide Hills.

30106,Australia,"How to virtually guarantee a luxury wine will be undervalued? Put it out under mass-market branding. If a wine this quality were marketed as boutique, it would likely sell for much more, as it's a terrific example of old-vine Barossa Valley Shiraz. It's strongly marked by toasty oak, but the underlying fruit is bold and ripe without being overdone or jammy and the wine is modern without being devoid of structure or savoriness.

30394,Australia,"Turkey Flat's Shiraz is a Barossa classic, and the 2008 shows no ill effects of the heatwave that struck during vintage. It's intensely concentrated and richly textured, with fresh black currant notes accented by hints of mocha and mint. Finishing firm and crisp without being edgy, this has just the right structure to carry it through at least 2025.",,92,60,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Turkey Flat
30400,Australia,"A terrific value for the price, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that looks capable of aging through at least 2025.

30697,Australia,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",Green's Vineyard,92,70,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
30698,Australia,"If not the oldest, the vineyard is home to some of the oldest Shiraz vines in the world (planted in 1843).

45735,Australia,"Zippy and zesty, with scents of fresh lime, cut grass and passionfruit, this is a nose that's firing on all cylinders.

Drink up.",,84,9,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Kilda
45816,Australia,"This is a fresh and elegant take, a good choice for those who find some Shiraz to be heavy-handed.

48261,Australia,"There's a lifted quality to the bouquet of this wine that's slightly distracting, but also plenty of cherry fruit. In fact, it's the somewhat monolithic nature of the fruit that's most disappointing; for a wine of this lauded reputation there needs to be more evidence of complexity.

Approachable now, but probably best from 2010 to 2020.",The Reserve,93,,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Whistler
57751,Australia,"At this young age and only a couple of months after bottling, the French oak is showing a bit in the smoky, toasty aromas. But there's plenty of fruit to balance out the wood???plummy, fruitcake-like flavors that wash over the palate in creamy, lush waves. Mouthfilling and rich, with a supple, long finish; if it's a trifle less complex and structured than the 2004, it makes up for it in sheer lusciousness. Drink now???2015.",Platinum Label,93,85,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Wolf Blass
57752,Australia,"Practically roars from the glass with vanilla and spice, yet despite aging in mainly new French oak, the fruit flows forth in waves, adding cherries and blackberries to the mix. Creamy, lush and mouthfilling, this is a top-notch effort that may be drunk now and over the next 15 or more years.",RWT,93,82,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Penfolds
57755,Australia,"A terrific value, this boasts knockout aromas of blueberry pie and cracked pepper, followed by a velvety, rich texture and flavors that pick up hints of additional spice, grilled meat and black olive. It juxtaposes ripeness, texture and complexity to make a complete package worth cellaring until 2010 and drinking over the following 10 years.",Dry Bore,93,27,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Glen Eldon
57756,Australia,". Smoky and cedary on the nose, with hints of cured meat that accent the explosive red fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth, the tannins wonderfully supple but undeniably present, elegantly framing the lingering, spicy finish. Drink now???2020.",The Octavius,93,100,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Yalumba
57758,Australia,"This has a distinctly spicy, savory, meaty quality to its aromas, possibly due to the one-third of the blend that comes from Eden Valley. Those elements impart great complexity to this wine, building on its core of blackberry fruit. Like all the Torbreck wines, this shows a rich, layered texture and a long finish. Drink now???2020.",The Struie,93,50,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Torbreck
57759,Australia,"Lush and chocolaty, yet also filled with layers of cherry fruit. Winemaker Stuart Bourne compares it to Cherry Ripe, an Australian candy bar similar to Mounds with cherry mixed into the coconut filling, and he's spot on. This starts off creamy-smooth, then develops a velvety edge of tannin on the long finish. Close in quality to the still-stunning 1998; drink now???2020. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",E&E; Black Pepper,93,90,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
57760,Australia,"Big and bold, like the excellent '04 version. If anything, it emphasizes the fruit even a bit more, with less spicy complexity, but it's a black hole of plum and blackberry fruit that explodes in the mouth, staining the palate with fruity intensity. The alcohol level must be elevated, but it's well concealed by supple tannins. Drink now???2015.",The Bogan,93,65,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kaesler
57762,Australia,"Smells almost Port-like, with expansive aromas of fruit cake, maple syrup and chocolate, then delivers a similar array of flavors, although completely dry. Full-bodied, lush and richly textured, this is almost too much, although the intriguing spice notes of cinnamon, clove and allspice help rein in the waves of chocolate and dried fruit. Long, velvety and slightly warm on the finish. Drink now???2015.",Apricot Block,93,55,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Greenock Creek
57764,Australia,"A standout Stonewell, the 1996 still appears to have a decade or more of life still ahead of it. Smoke and mint notes mark the slightly closed nose, then layers of wonderfully creamy black cherry fruit flow across the palate. Yet despite the lush mouthfeel, the wine still comes across as structured on the long finish. Drink now???2020.",Stonewell,93,75,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
57765,Australia,"Somehow winemaker Rolf Binder manages to combine cool, savory aspects with bold, ripe-fruit flavors. The 2005 Heysen marries cinnamon, clove and peppery spice with blackberries and plums, tying it all together with a robe of vanilla and chocolaty oak and finishing with a hint of espresso. This is a creamy, full-bodied wine whose fruit conceals considerable tannin; drink 2010???2020.",Heysen,93,45,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Rolf Binder
57766,Australia,"In the cool 2004 vintage, the nearly 100-year-old vines of Henschke's Mount Edelstone Vineyard have yielded a tart, crisp wine of considerable cellaring potential. The scents of pepper, blackberries and potpourri and flavors of vanilla and raspberries are buoyed by velvety tannins and a creamy mouthfeel, tightening up on the long finish. May not be as flashy as the 2003, but it may live longer. Drink 2012???2030.",Mount Edelstone Vineyard,92,100,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
57770,Australia,"Full-throttle, obvious Barossa-style Shiraz, loaded with vanilla-scented oak, but also with blackberry fruit.

57771,Australia,"Creamy-textured, full-bodied and showing a bit of warmth, this is lush and lavishly oaked.

Likely to mature quickly; drink now???2012.",Moorooroo Limited Release,92,85,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Schild Estate
57772,Australia,"Nicely balanced, with subtle suede, cinnamon, plum and berry aromas and flavors. This is supple just to the point of being a bit creamy in the mouth, with a long, velvety finish. Approachable now, but should improve through at least 2012.",Bella's Garden,92,60,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Two Hands
57773,Australia,"A single-vineyard wine that contains about 85% Shiraz, 10% Mourv??dre and 5% Grenache, this is an incredibly concentrated wine. Slightly lifted aromas keep it from seeming heavy, but the flavors are dense and fudge-like, chocolaty and superripe. Dusty tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through 2010, and it should age well through at least 2020.",Exile,92,160,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,The Colonial Estate
57775,Australia,"Even more spicy and meaty in nature than Gibson's Barossa bottling, this microcuv??e???only 160 cases were bottled???highlights the savory side of Eden Valley Shiraz.

58010,Australia,"The Bull continues to offer reasonably good value, featuring bold fruit aromas and plenty of flavor intensity for the price.

A solid steakhouse red.",,87,18,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Angus The Bull
58043,Australia,"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",Nine Gums Vineyard,85,30,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Brick Road
58052,Australia,"The inclusion of a large proportion of Eden Valley fruit gives this wonderfully complex aromas of cracked peppers and dried spices, which build upon a solid core of ripe blackberry fruit. Creamy and lush on the midpalate, it firms up considerably by the finish. This stays true to Wolf Blass's approachable style while layering on additional depth and potential longevity. Drink now???2016 and possibly beyond.",Platinum Label,92,85,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Wolf Blass
58053,Australia,"Despite a challenging year in the Barossa, especially for Cabernet, this is a charming, medium-bodied wine that should drink well for the next 8 years or so. Aromas are slightly leafy and herbal, but also feature plenty of red currant fruit, while the tannins are well-ripened but still show typical Cab structure. Long on the finish.",Rifle Range,92,,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rockford
58059,Australia,"On the elegant side for Barossa, with polished textures and a long finish.

58062,Australia,"Behind some mint, eucalyptus and cedar aromas, this is a big, meaty Cabernet, with lots of flesh and power. The tight cassis fruit needs some time to unfold and the mouthdrying tannins need some time to resolve, but all the ingredients for future excellence are in place. Drink 2012???2020.

58078,Australia,"A bit closed and brooding on the nose, showing merely traces of dark chocolate and espresso. Despite its sullen state, this wine's potential is clear from its ample weight and structure, dark chocolate and plum flavors and promising finish, which brightens to add raspberries and a hint of black pepper. Drink 2010???2020.",Greenock,92,40,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kalleske

58084,Australia,"Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well.

Drink now???2016.",,91,21,Victoria,Victoria,,Riesling,Mount Langi Ghiran
58089,Australia,"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors.

58090,Australia,"A big (15.6% alcohol) wine, the 2006 Bella's Garden nevertheless comes across as balanced and drinkable in its youth, marrying a rich, creamy texture with mixed berry fruit and hints of mint and vanilla.

58354,Australia,"Although it's not indicated on the front label, this is 100% Shiraz, sourced from 60-year-old vines in the Ebenezer district and 90-year-old vines near Gomersal. It's Teusner's best wine, loaded with spice and savory notes that perfectly highlight the rich blackberry fruit. Not jammy or overblown, it has enough structure to suggest a drinking window from 2010???2020.",Albert,92,60,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Teusner
58357,Australia,"Tight and oaky at first, but this gradually opens with air to reveal copious blueberry and blackberry aromas and flavors.

58359,Australia,"Past vintages of Elderton wines have been heavily oaked, and this wine is no exception???plenty of cedary, vanilla-laden aromas burst from the glass.

58363,Australia,"This is prototypical Barossa Valley Shiraz, boasting a big, lush mouthfeel and great depth of ripe fruit.

58369,Australia,"An immensely aromatic expression of Barossa Shiraz, with bold notes of menthol, raspberries, chocolate and spice all bursting forth. The flavors are similar, and similarly expressive, although this wine lacks some of the richness of texture found in Greenock Creek's 2004 Alices or Apricot Block Shirazes.

58390,Australia,"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country.

May develop through 2015.",Bolero,90,16,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Marlargo
58392,Australia,"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010???2020.",Savitar,90,66,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
58393,Australia,"Daryl Groom has turned out a reasonably bold, intense Sauvignon Blanc that weighs in under 13% alcohol yet manages to avoid tasting malnourished or underripe.

58406,Australia,"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors.

58954,Australia,"Seemingly fully mature, this still shows a dark, saturated color, but the flavors are moving from sour plum fruit to more meaty, savory flavors with plenty of pepper and spice.

58969,Australia,"A step up in seriousness from Craneford's easy-drinking regular Shiraz, the Fire Station bottling is sourced from 80-year-old vines from the northern Barossa.

59079,Australia,"This is pretty oaky stuff, loaded with toast and cedar aromas, but still showing some lush blueberry fruit underneath.

59297,Australia,"This is the current release of Grant Burge's Meshach, which is typically held back for additional bottle age???the already bottled 2005 will be released in 2010.

This vintage offers penetrating eucalyptus, white pepper, even meaty aromas. The palate is full and rich, dealing mixed berries, plum, eucalyptus and a hint of caramel.

Its nose deals a different fragrance every time you go back to it: nut, focused yellow fruit, cola, then fresh baked pastry.

Floral notes perk up the aromas while cherries and berries flavor the palate, turning a bit crisp on the finish. Drink now???2011.",Gold Label,88,25,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Wolf Blass
61519,Australia,"Complex and supple, but lacks just a bit of energy and vigor; the fruit comes across as a bit dried rather than pristinely fresh, with hints of molasses and brown sugar. Still, there's plenty of it, matched by hints of pepper, grilled meat, coffee and vanilla. Drink now and over the next few years.",1928,88,40,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,JJ Hahn
61522,Australia,"The American oak still clearly shows in this wine, which features vanilla and a touch of dill on the nose, but also blackberry and cherry fruit and a hint of milk chocolate. It's become creamy and soft with age, adding tobacco notes to vanilla and crisp berry flavors on the finish. Drink up.",Stonewell,88,36,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
61524,Australia,"Mint and cassis aromas and flavors also pick up a slightly pruny or raisiny edge, and this wine does show some alcoholic warmth in the finish, evidence of superripe???maybe even overripe???fruit. It is dark and lush, with supple tannins and a full mouthfeel so on balance it's a very good wine, just be aware that it may be overdone for some tastes.",Basket Pressed,88,30,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tait Wines
61525,Australia,"Aged entirely in American oak, and it shows a bit on the nose, where hints of dill and menthol give a greenish tinge to the vanilla and blackberry aromas. Crisp and juicy,  with some powdery-textured tannins on the finish that should resolve rapidly over the next few years.",Blackwell,88,35,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,St Hallett
61574,Australia,"A classic Clare Valley Riesling, with prominent lime zest and kiwi character upfront and an energetic, zesty mouth bursting with well-integrated acidity and green apple notes. Finishes on a tasty tone of lime cordial. Drink now or age a few years.",Barking Mad,88,13,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Reilly's
61592,Australia,"This is classically styled Australian Cabernet, which is to say it's not overly weighty or rich, opting instead for restraint and archetypal aromas and flavors of tobacco and cedar.

61644,Australia,"Excellent in large part for being quite different from other Shirazes: This one offers an overarching exotic quality, which manifests itself as spice on the palate, and as pipe tobacco, fireplace and black licorice on the nose.

61669,Australia,"At first sniff, this seems overly oaky, stuffed with vanilla, cedar and wood spice, but give it a chance.

Drink now???2012.",Blackwell,91,35,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,St Hallett
61678,Australia,"Sorry to steal the moniker from the company's Shiraz, but this is Classic Clare too, offering bold flavors of honey-coated minerals perked up by curls of lime zest.

62048,Australia,"Soft and fleshy in texture, with slightly pruny dark plum fruit and a charming hint of black licorice. Supple tannins frame the crisp finish.

62056,Australia,"Recently bottled, Craneford's 2006 Shiraz is very youthful and primary, with cherry-berry aromas and flavors completely dominating at this stage.

62059,Australia,"Starts off a bit tarry and meaty, but those elements are balanced by baking spices and blackberry pie.

62179,Australia,"Winemaker Noel Heidenreich's Shiraz is compelling, not overwhelming, with some vanilla flavors framing juicy red plum and raspberry fruit.

62180,Australia,"A crisp, cool style of Shiraz???if you think ??úeucalyptus??ù equals ??úmedicinal,??ù this probably isn't your cup of tea. But there's a lot to like about this wine's gumtree, black pepper and blackberry aromas, and the way that its earth-clay feel steals the show on the palate.

Imported by Pan Pacific Wines.",Grand Reserve,90,55,South Australia,Wrattonbully,,Shiraz,Pepper Tree
62185,Australia,"This Sauvignon starts off with a very pretty lemon meringue aroma, which translates on the palate as a dusty-citrus core. There's a helping of fresh green herbs and peas just at palate entry, with white peach and green apple flavors on the midpalate. Round and a shade less zesty than it has been in previous vintages, but still one of the prettier Hills SBs available in the U.S.",,89,17,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Sauvignon Blanc,Groom
62186,Australia,"This couldn't be from anywhere but Coonawarra: its clay-earth texture is its hallmark. Flavors of plum, bramble, mint and spice persist through the finish.

62292,Australia,"A top-flight value, this bargain Shiraz features briary, savory notes layered over a base of tart blackberries.

Drink now.",Vision,87,12,New South Wales,Riverina,,Shiraz,Nugan Family Estates

62596,Australia,"Deep inky-red in color, this Shiraz's name is an easy clue to how it behaves in the mouth. It's a wine to be reckoned with, full and round.

Finishes warm and spicy.",The Ripper!,89,15,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Shiraz,Hope Estate
62598,Australia,"This is a young Cab, not meant to be drunk for another 3???5 years at least. At this stage, it takes a long time in the glass to reveal its black cherry, eucalyptus and soil flavors; its tealike tannins reign for now.

62715,Australia,"This wine poses an interesting contrast to the regular bottling, as it's lower in alcohol and also tighter and more structured.

62924,Australia,"This is 80% Shiraz, with the remainder split evenly between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

62966,Australia,"This South Eastern Australia Chard packs quite a punch for the price. The nose is fresh but subtle, with hints of hand soap and cut apples.

Drink now through 2011.",Estate Range,86,9,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Beelgara
62997,Australia,"Opens deep and inky with prune, licorice, chocolate, Asian spices and a touch of leather. If you think that's a lot of nose for a $13 Shiraz, you're right.

63489,Australia,"Ripe and buttery with tropical fruit and oak on the nose, this Chardonnay has decent mouthfeel and an attractive sweet-tart profile.

63808,Australia,"Dark garnet-black in color, but as dark as it is, this is not one of those explosive, overextracted types of New World Pinot. This one serves up cherry flavors that are juicy but just shy of tart, and they're coated in a hefty helping of chalk or mineral. Narrow but very nice; finishes with an old-school iron-ore flavor.",Nantua Vineyard,90,100,Victoria,Victoria,,Pinot Noir,Giaconda
63843,Australia,"Opens with a stylized nose that displays cassis, mint, leather and even toasted marshmallow notes. It's unique, and draws you in to the unusual, sweet caramel-spice and dark cherry flavor combination the palate offers. A long finish with good tannic structure closes this harmonious wine. Lots of oak, but it works well here. Editors' Choice.",,91,25,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yalumba

63857,Australia,"Dense, dark, and young, this beauty is brimming with thrillingly clean, upscale fruit, if you can find it under heavy tannins.

The overall result is a fancy, very good Cab.",Show Reserve,90,24,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rosemount
63858,Australia,"This is the kind of wine that showcases just how distinctive and special Australia can be across so many varietals. It unites ripe, tropical-fruity characteristics with mineral and herbal ones, and yokes them together with smoky oak. There's very great fruity extract, but it's not over the top, and the acidity, as usual, is high and makes things shine.

63863,Australia,"The intensity and depth of this blockbuster from the Barossa Valley are noted right at the start. Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and a touch of pepper roar off the nose and continue in full stride through the mid-palate and on to the long finish. There's an underpinning of even tannins, good acidity, a round supple body, and a texture like velvet. This is a wine for hearty fare or to contemplate with the cheese course.",Boundary Row,90,25,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kurtz Family

64138,Australia,"To me, Glen Eldon's Dry Bore Shiraz exemplifies many of the positive attributes of Barossa Shiraz. The blackberry fruit is powerful, complemented by copious vanilla and toast notes from oak maturation. There's plenty of weight and concentration, but no excessively dry or hard tannins???in fact, it's almost silky.

It's full and plush in the mouth, finishing a little fat.",,89,18,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Simon Hackett
64242,Australia,"The pear, apple and herb aromas and flavors here are almost swamped by the spicy oak. Bright acidity and the powerful wood presence give the wine a rather lean cast, but this ship rights itself, and keeps its balance nicely in the end.

Good now, and should improve for two to four years.",Bin 555,88,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Wyndham Estate
64248,Australia,"In a style that nods more to Bordeaux than the New World, the cassis, tobacco and herb bouquet shows class and style. Displays fine balance and good acidity, which supports the ripe black-currant fruit, cedar and peppery notes. It's structured rather than plush, and finishes long, dry and toasty.

64384,Australia,"Nicely built on a solid red fruit core, the berry, cherry and licorice aromas and flavors here wear a heavy wood cloak that holds the fruit in check a bit too much. It's hard not to feel that the full potential of the fruit has been stymied here. Still, the mouthfeel is good and it finishes with attractive, spicy dry cherry, anise and wood notes. Will appeal more to lovers of lavish oak.",Filsell,87,25,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
64399,Australia,"Here's one of the bigger Chards of the year. Explodes with aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and, oh yes, tropical fruits. The flavors are mouth-filling and rich, like a sweet, custardy, creamy, tangerine-flavored dessert, yet it's dry. However, it loses a few points for being too big and aggressive without the necessary balance. It's awkward.",Giant's Creek,87,17,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
64403,Australia,"An overripe quality to the blackberry-liqueur fruit, especially on the nose, marks this lovable sweet jam-fest.

133354,Australia,"The Y Series is Yalumba's entry-level under their own label (the company also produces the Oxford Landing range).

133418,Australia,"This is a rich, powerfully oaky Shiraz, but masses of fruit show through on the finish, offering hope for the future. Now, it will appeal to the same steakhouse crowds who love Silver Oak and Caymus, but in a year or two expect the oak to partially integrate and the wine to become more complete.

133562,Australia,"Nicely complex, this offering combines cherry fruit with plenty of leathery, smoky and herbal nuances. In fact, one might argue there's a touch too much leather, as it seems to dull the fruit slightly, smoothing out any rough edges, but also lessening the fruit's bite.

137933,Australia,"Of Clarendon Hills' three Cabs, this one is generally considered the flagship. This vintage, the Hickinbotham is a darker, more brooding sort of Cab than the other two, with drying, tealike tannins in the mouth and bramble aromas.

137951,Australia,"Shiraz complexity in a glass: herbal, smoky and meaty, all tied together by a core of berryish fruit.

140620,Australia,"Many of the 2007 Shirazes from South Australia exhibit slightly gritty tannins, and Duval's Entity is a prime example. There's ample concentration and attractive raspberry fruit, pointed up by darker, savory overtones of olive and chocolate.

140627,Australia,"Made by Reid Bosward of Kaesler, this is a chance to taste his handiwork at a reasonable price. The wine delivers plummy, meaty, slightly herbal aromas, then turns more savory on the palate, suggesting mixed olives. In a word, it's complex.

142031,Australia,"Smells spicy, and similar smoke and spice flavors resurface on the palate. This is not a big, overdone style of Shiraz, but it's still a nice one. It has flavors of smoke and red fruit. Flashy and substantial on the midpalate???with good, gripping tannins and a smooth texture???but the palate entry and finish are not quite as impressive.",Basket Pressed,88,28,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Chateau Reynella
142039,Australia,"Clean, correct and enjoyable; this Riesling is well balanced, with a dry feel and citrus, olive oil and floral components through and through.

Its flavors are similar: dried fruit, wheat and nut, but more subdued than it is on the nose.

Future vintages, he says, will get more oak.",,87,13,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Chardonnay,Fox Creek
142601,Australia,"The nose offers a host of red aromas, including stewy, almost tomatoey fruit, and pretty red pencil eraser.

142603,Australia,"Starts off beautifully, with earthy-meaty aromas and vibrant, juicy fruit on palate entry.

Very pretty at first; maybe next vintage won't be quite as woody.",Old Vine,87,15,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Normans

142707,Australia,"An excellent wine as it always is, but this vintage of Grange is one that isn't just built for aging, it requires it. Its flavors and aromas require a good 20 minutes in the glass to show themselves, but with time, pretty eucalyptus/mint and anise aromas come through. In the mouth, this vintage feels more feminine than other recent vintages. It's very tightly wound, with tea, biscuit and plum notes peeking through; its tannins are powdery and pretty, and its finish long and juicy.

Enjoy with charcuterie.",,87,18,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Simon Hackett

142877,Australia,"The palate announced loud and clear what this wine's color and aromas also suggest: There's just too much wood here.

143177,Australia,"Smells like a blended fruit-box juice, and gives a similar impression on the palate. Distinct red raspberry, plum, apple and grape flavors rides some rough wood on the palate.

Very enjoyable.",,90,30,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Vasse Felix
143791,Australia,"From winemaker John Davey, a wine with jammy berries on the nose and a pleasing, round mouthfeel.

148399,Australia,"Full but not overoaked nor overly rich, the Scotsdale Cab is a winner this vintage. The nose's black cherry, clay and light herb notes get deeper the longer the wine sits. On the palate, smoldering, smoky notes envelope tight red cherry and berry flavors. Seems to have an almost Chianti-like, iron-ore core. Very nice. Probably best drunk after 2009.

148447,Australia,"Most of the higher-tier Grant Burge Shirazes this vintage were excellent, so maybe it's not such a surprise that this one is just good.

148698,Australia,"This is the kind of wine that showcases just how distinctive and special Australia can be across so many varietals. It unites ripe, tropical-fruity characteristics with mineral and herbal ones, and yokes them together with smoky oak. There's very great fruity extract, but it's not over the top, and the acidity, as usual, is high and makes things shine.

Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and a touch of pepper roar off the nose and continue in full stride through the mid-palate and on to the long finish.

149132,Australia,"This is a nice, easygoing Chardonnay. Apple with a touch of oak are the flavors. Crisp acidity and a creamy mouthfeel lead into a long finish. A seafood salad would make good company for this one.",,85,14,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Abbey Vale
149133,Australia,"Tropical fruits start this one off and on the palate, toasted oak and butterscotch join in. The structure is solid and the acid just right. This is a clean, decent Chardonnay.",,85,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Bulletin Place
149134,Australia,"Aromas and flavors of pear and lemon. Neither fat nor flamboyant, it has appeal because of its poise and restraint???adjectives formerly not often associated with Australian Chardonnay. A fine choice for light foods or just to sip on its own.",,85,10,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Barossa Valley Estate
149144,Australia,"Dominated by blackberry notes, this is an easy rider that you can enjoy any night. The tannins are soft, the mouthfeel smooth and the finish long. Enjoy it with some pasta. Best Buy.",,85,7,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Yellow Tail
149151,Australia,"This simple Cabernet opens with berry and tobacco aromas. There's a sweet and sour quality to the fruit, like stewed cherries and rhubarb. It's light and easy on the palate. All in all, a decent straightforward quaff.",,84,7,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alice White
149197,Australia,"Very dry, as Clare Rieslings should be, this is an ideal pre-dinner sip. Its flavors are palate cleansing and subtle???think citrus peel and mineral/stone, and its acidity is just tangy enough. Olive oil, cracker and citrus aromas start it all off. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",,87,14,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Annie's Lane
149198,Australia,"Blackberry, maple and smoke aromas lead to juicy blackberry and raspberry flavors on the palate. Offers up smooth tannins in a narrow pathway through the finish. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",Ebenezer,87,35,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
149200,Australia,"This Chard has good intensity and length for a wine of its price. It starts off with fresh cream, nut and white peach aromas, followed by focused peach, pear and chalk flavors. Not a heavyweight at all, but even and constant. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Moore's Creek,87,10,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Tyrrell's
149203,Australia,"Has very nice spicy, smoky aromas and a hearty dose of red raspberry and plum flavors, and lively acidity. Imported by The Country Vintner.",,87,19,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,West Cape Howe
149216,Australia,"This medium-sized, food-friendly Cab isn't fancy, but it has a nice rustic, earthy quality to its red berry fruit. Claylike smoothness on the palate ends with some light tea tannins. Imported by Bluewater Wine Co.",The Benefit,87,15,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tim Adams
149218,Australia,"Though there are moderate doses of toast and nut adding interest to yellow peach and pineapple flavors, the wood manifests itself differently on the nose and the finish. Smells like pine, dried spice and burned popcorn, with bacon, hickory and some lactic notes coming through on the finish. Goes down easily, but could have fared even better. Imported by The Country Vintner.",,87,27,Western Australia,Pemberton,,Chardonnay,Picardy
149222,Australia,"Tropical fruit and tangy lemon aromas and flavors are nearly buried under dense oak here, but when they peek through they are bright and pleasing. The acids are sharp, but in here they seem to help the fruit cut through the wood veneer. Good, but a lighter hand letting the fruit shine more would be even better.",,84,12,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Chardonnay,Tatachilla
149224,Australia,"Apple, pear and oak aromas and flavors prevail in this simple but not unattractive blend from several regions. Good acidity and a round mouthfeel help it along. Good for poolside or hors d'oeuvres.",Nottage Hill,83,7,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Hardys
149226,Australia,"This light- to medium-weight wine features a bouquet of berry and earth aromas and mature Cabernet flavors. The wood doesn't overwhelm, but the mouthfeel is slightly prickly and astringent, and the fruit doesn't really sing. Closes with mild tobacco notes.",Bin 444,83,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wyndham Estate
149230,Australia,"After the fairly hearty sulfur on the nose blows off, the berry and chocolate aromas and flavors here are light and wear a lot of wood for the weight of the fruit. There's decent mouthfeel and some woody tannins on the back end of this simple quaffer.",,83,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Alice White
149232,Australia,"There isn't much depth here,  and the cassis flavor has a chemical aspect to it. The structure, however, is fine and the finish long. It's a lightweight but shouldn't be difficult to enjoy with some roast beef.",,83,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,McPherson Wine Company
149233,Australia,"The label on this wine says ??úunwooded Chardonnay,??ù and in this case that seems to be part of the problem. This is a case of just too little fruit???the wine could certainly use some wood for texture, even flavor. There's a taut framework, but there's not much on it.",,82,11,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Chardonnay,David Wynn
149266,Australia,"This Sauvignon Blanc boasts lively acidity, and flavors of citrus peel and white pepper. Has a tiny bit of spritz on the palate, followed up by nectarine flavors on the finish.",Y Series,86,11,South Australia,South Australia,,Sauvignon Blanc,Yalumba
149351,Australia,"From vineyards 600 meters above sea level comes a Chard with white peach and mineral notes at its core. On the nose, they're dressed up in a subtle dose of burnt sugar; on the palate, they're backed up with vanilla and floral notes. Soft and even a little oily in feel. 20,000 cases produced. Imported by Cumulus Wines Inc.",,86,13,Australia Other,Central Ranges,,Chardonnay,Rolling
149352,Australia,"An accessibly styled Riesling, by which I mean that the mouthfeel is a little rounder and acidity is a little lower than it could be. Has fragrant lime and pink grapefruit notes on the nose, with plenty more lime and dust on the palate. Imported by The Country Vintner.",,86,17,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Riesling,West Cape Howe
149354,Australia,"Nutty, peachy aromas; similar flavors, plus flashes of white pepper, come through on the palate. Wide and soft but not full, easy but not profound. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",Hill of Gold,86,13,New South Wales,Mudgee,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
149360,Australia,"This is an approachable, easy Chardonnay that won't break the bank. It offers light hay, cream and spice aromas that usher in peach and citrus flavors on the palate. Soft around the edges, with a wiry core. 5,000 cases produced. Imported by The Country Vintner.",,86,7,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Kilda
149362,Australia,"This Chard relies heavily on oak to get its message across. It's gold in color, with aromas of butterscotch and pickling spice. Hefty wood and a lactic notecoats firm yellow peach fruit on the palate. Has a nice mouthfeel, though???it's the texture of smooth river rocks. Imported by The Country Vintner.",,86,18,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Chardonnay,West Cape Howe
149363,Australia,"This is a lighter-style Chard that's pleasing and easy to drink. Light nut, floral and white stone fruit aromas lead to a palate that's full of chalk and almond-like flavors, finally finishing with some pear. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",Yellow Label,86,12,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Wolf Blass
149369,Australia,"Aromas start sweet, then grow tomatoey and earthy with air. The palate offers lifted berry and cherry fruit countered by an herbal, almost sour, greenness that lasts through the finish. It's a well-made wine with a smooth, chalky feel, but its flavors are not all that harmonious. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.",The Coppermine Road,86,65,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Arenberg
149433,Australia,"Penetrating eucalyptus aromas largely obscure the sweet berry fruit underneath. Berries rule the palate, too, which has soft tannins and tangy, tea-oak notes on the back. Imported by Bluewater Wine Co.",The Benefit,86,,South Australia,Southern Flinders Ranges,,Shiraz,Tim Adams
149438,Australia,"Very fragrant and tropical on the nose. In the mouth, this Chard offers the same pear, banana and other tropical fruits spread broadly across the palate. Its texture is a little thick, but at this price, this wine more than does its job. Imported by Freixenet USA.",,85,9,Victoria,Victoria,,Chardonnay,Deakin Estate
149441,Australia,"Very fragrant meat and hickory notes waft from the nose. Palate offers yellow peach and pear flavors, but a flat, dull feel. Weighty, rather than nimble, as a SB should be.",Western Branch,85,20,South Australia,Lenswood,,Sauvignon Blanc,Golding
149520,Australia,"I've liked other Taltarni wines more than this, and many a fan will surely find this score stingy. If lifted berry fruit couched in maple syrup notes and soft tannins gets you going, this is right on the mark. This reviewer prefers more acid, and less  sweetness. Imported by Clos Du Val Wine.",,85,35,Victoria,Heathcote,,Shiraz,Taltarni
149536,Australia,"Has a nice intensity of flavor???lemon, peach and pineapple, mostly???and wide, fragrant lemon and mineral aromas. Does it taste like you'd expect Riesling to taste? Maybe not. But if this zesty but soft-around-the-edges wine turns more people on to the variety, let it flow. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",,85,5,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Riesling,Banrock Station
149548,Australia,"Its aromas are quite nice???clay, black cherry, eraser, graham cracker--but the palate doesn't deliver the goods quite as prettily. Has a papery/wooly feel; fruit has a green, sourish edge. Not imported to the U.S.",,84,17,New South Wales,Orange,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Climbing
149612,Australia,Offers perfumed floral/minerally notes on the nose. The palate deals citrus and dust flavors that aren't very detailed. A fine quaff. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.,Reserve,84,13,South Australia,South Australia,,Riesling,Jacob's Creek

149621,Australia,"Starts off with grassy, fresh herbal aromas and flavors of almond. After a second look, it's all lemon and grapefruit flavors, with an edge of sweetness???almost like a lemon tart. Slim in size, soft in feel. An easy quaff.",Zeepaard,84,10,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Sauvignon Blanc,West Cape Howe

149639,Australia,"Smooth in the mouth, this Chard starts off with citrus and dust aromas with a light edging of cake frosting. In the mouth, it's tauter and more austere than it usually is. Clean and not a vibrant wine, but that's a matter of preference. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",,84,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek

150468,Australia,"There's nothing subtle about this intensely fruity wine. It's ripe black cherries all the way, with hints of chocolate and wintergreen. The tannins are soft, the acids low, but the flavors are so pretty that the lack of structure isn't a big issue in this everyday drinker.",,85,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Teal Lake
150562,Australia,"As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.",Grange,96,185,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150563,Australia,"Seamless luxury from stem to stern, this ???baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country.

150570,Australia,"The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5???8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.",Bin 707,93,90,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150571,Australia,"This big wine presents a sophisticated bouquet of toasty, leesy, nutty aromas. Fine depth of fruit and plenty of quality oak show here, with butterscotch, pear and apple flavors.

Quite flavorful and elegant.",Bin 407,90,19,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150607,Australia,"Comes on full and lush from the opening, with blackberry, chocolate, menthol and smoke aromas. In the mouth it delivers dark, dry flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak and has good acidity that keeps it from getting mushy. The solid finish offers more of the same, a nice spiciness and some substantial tannins. Drink now; should be even better in two years.",Bin 128,90,22,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150621,Australia,"Made for almost 40 years???since 1962???this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.",Bin 389,89,19,Australia Other,Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150634,Australia,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white.
