660,Australia,"This crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet.",Applejack Vineyard,88,42,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Pinot Noir,Giant Steps
825,Australia,"The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018Ç??2030.",The Dead Arm,90,65,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
987,Australia,"This is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha.

2025,Australia,"This medium-bodied Shiraz is refreshingly medium-bodied and drinkable, with softly dusty tannins on the finish that don't get in the way of present enjoyment.

2028,Australia,"From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish. Drink now, or hold through at least 2020 to allow for more development.",1927 Vines,90,33,Victoria,Nagambie Lakes,,Marsanne,Tahbilk
2148,Australia,"Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink nowÇ??2030.",The Factor,98,125,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Torbreck
2325,Australia,"Based in Clare Valley, Wakefield sources this fruit from the cooler Adelaide Hills.

2379,Australia,"This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannicÇ??almost more of a light red than a true ros??. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.",Handpicked Grenache,90,25,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Ros??,Beresford
2398,Australia,"This is deliberately picked early to preserve acidity and aging potential.

If you prefer additional richness, hold until at least 2020.",1927 Vines,89,34,Victoria,Nagambie Lakes,,Marsanne,Tahbilk
2458,Australia,"This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured.

Drink now through 2018.",,89,20,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Pinot Noir,Sidewood

3033,Australia,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft.

Drink nowÇ??2030.",Mount Edelstone Vineyard,95,200,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
3047,Australia,"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated.

3584,Australia,"This medium-bodied Shiraz represents a solid value.

3934,Australia,"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic.

3935,Australia,"A classic blend of Cabernet and Shiraz, this is cedary and complex upon opening, easily mixing cassis, plum and blackberry with vanilla and baking spices. On the palate, it's dense and concentrated yet slightly reserved, suggesting rather than screaming its potential.

3958,Australia,"With only 12% new oak and 28% of the fruit coming from the cool Eden Valley, this wine may hold more appeal to lovers of Old World Syrah than any other Torbreck bottling. Pepper, bacon fat and mixed berries mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and expansive. The long finish includes enough soft, dusty tannins to suggest cellaring through 2030 as a possibility, although it's delicious now.",The Struie,94,50,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Torbreck

4480,Australia,"One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either.

5378,Australia,"Tasted together with the 2013, this is everything its younger brother is, but ever-so-slightly less intense.

27296,Australia,"This is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit.

27298,Australia,"This top-flight effort reveals bold aromas of lime and crushed oyster shells. It's a medium-bodied wine that's tight and zesty, filled with flavors reminiscent of iodine and citrus on the long, dry finish. It should age gracefully through at least 2025.",Mort's Reserve Watervale,91,35,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Kilikanoon
27625,Australia,"Crisp and compact, the 2011 Diana Madeline undoubtedly needs at least another couple of years in the cellar.

28169,Australia,"For such a young wine, this seems surprisingly developedÇ??or maybe it's just riper than usual.

28625,Australia,"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest.

28632,Australia,"Winemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade.

In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla.

28731,Australia,"In the context of 2010, I have to admit to some disappointment with how this wine is showing. It's still an excellent wine, filled with luscious oak and bold fruit. But the fruit is slightly stewed, the tannins slightly coarse and the wine's structure a bit open knit.

28853,Australia,"Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that.

29104,Australia,"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around.

29768,Australia,"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030.",St. Henri,93,99,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds

Drink now.",Whippet,89,21,South Australia,Adelaide,,Sauvignon Blanc,Longview
46563,Australia,"Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar.

46581,Australia,"You might not know it from this wine's rather austere exterior, but this is actually from a warm site within the cool Yarra Valley. It's a restrained, slightly herbal blend of 62% Cabernet, 27% Merlot and 11% Petit Verdot that finishes with a tough mouthful of tannin. Hold it for another 3Ç??4 years and hope that the fruit holds up.",Harry's Monster,89,30,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Giant Steps

46727,Australia,"Snap this one up for its refreshing herbal, lemon and pine-scented nose and its flavorful palate with burnt orange and pineapple tones. More refreshing and subtle than most Chardonnays in this price range, this wine is a good pick for someone who wants a dash of Old World austerity and elegance in their New World wine.

47036,Australia,"Honest and straightforward, with black cherry candy and strawberry fruit upfront that give way to flavors of mixed berries and pepper in the mouth.

47977,Australia,"Nicely complex on the nose, delivering scents of ripe plums, roasted meat, wood smoke and peppery herbs.

The soft tannins amply frame the long, mouthwatering finish.",G.A.M.,92,50,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
57501,Australia,"Like all of the Clarendon Hills wines, this is packed with intensity. It's full-bodied, with soft tannins and a slightly low-acid, natural feel.

57553,Australia,"For the second consecutive vintage, this wine comes close to mimicking those elusive floral and spice elements of the northern Rh??ne.

57750,Australia,"Even though the vines were only planted in 1994, this is top-shelf stuff, dry grown, concentrated and intense. Bits of mint and licorice give dimension to the ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors, the mouthfeel is full and creamy and the finish turns dry and firm, showing solid structure. Approachable now, but probably best from 2010 to 2020.",The Reserve,93,,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Whistler
57751,Australia,"At this young age and only a couple of months after bottling, the French oak is showing a bit in the smoky, toasty aromas. But there's plenty of fruit to balance out the woodÇ??plummy, fruitcake-like flavors that wash over the palate in creamy, lush waves.

57755,Australia,"A terrific value, this boasts knockout aromas of blueberry pie and cracked pepper, followed by a velvety, rich texture and flavors that pick up hints of additional spice, grilled meat and black olive.

57757,Australia,"Winemaker David Powell gets this Grenache from vines planted in 1901 in Seppeltsfield. Their concentrated fruit yields a black-cherry-scented wine that's broad and mouthfilling, yet kept focused by flavors of earth and spice.

Drink nowÇ??2012.",Les Amis,93,145,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Torbreck
57758,Australia,"This has a distinctly spicy, savory, meaty quality to its aromas, possibly due to the one-third of the blend that comes from Eden Valley.

57759,Australia,"Lush and chocolaty, yet also filled with layers of cherry fruit. Winemaker Stuart Bourne compares it to Cherry Ripe, an Australian candy bar similar to Mounds with cherry mixed into the coconut filling, and he's spot on.

57765,Australia,"Somehow winemaker Rolf Binder manages to combine cool, savory aspects with bold, ripe-fruit flavors. The 2005 Heysen marries cinnamon, clove and peppery spice with blackberries and plums, tying it all together with a robe of vanilla and chocolaty oak and finishing with a hint of espresso. This is a creamy, full-bodied wine whose fruit conceals considerable tannin; drink 2010Ç??2020.",Heysen,93,45,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Rolf Binder
57766,Australia,"In the cool 2004 vintage, the nearly 100-year-old vines of Henschke's Mount Edelstone Vineyard have yielded a tart, crisp wine of considerable cellaring potential. The scents of pepper, blackberries and potpourri and flavors of vanilla and raspberries are buoyed by velvety tannins and a creamy mouthfeel, tightening up on the long finish.

57773,Australia,"A single-vineyard wine that contains about 85% Shiraz, 10% Mourv??dre and 5% Grenache, this is an incredibly concentrated wine.

58050,Australia,"Different in style from the equally good 2004, the 2005 Steading is a bigger, richer, warmer wine, with brandied cherry fruit flavors and a rather fat, almost oily mouthfeel.

58052,Australia,"The inclusion of a large proportion of Eden Valley fruit gives this wonderfully complex aromas of cracked peppers and dried spices, which build upon a solid core of ripe blackberry fruit.

58078,Australia,"A bit closed and brooding on the nose, showing merely traces of dark chocolate and espresso.

58364,Australia,"In contrast to many of the Barossa's Grenache-dominant blends, this is not a punchy, fruity, glug-it-down style. In fact, the operative word here is delicate, referring to the intricate interplay of spice, tea, herbs, rose petals and red cherries on the nose and the silky tannins on the palate.

May develop through 2015.",Bolero,90,16,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Marlargo
58392,Australia,"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010Ç??2020.",Savitar,90,66,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo

142787,Australia,"Has eucalyptus, earth and red plum aromas. This is a straightforward wine, but one that has surprising finesse, particularly given its reasonable price.

Aromas are alluring, but on the sweet sideÇ??blackberry, anise, creampuff, vanilla, sweet tart. Cocoa, carmel and raspberry flavors follow suit.

Solid and quite widely available, if perhaps a touch hotter and less well-defined than in its best years.",,85,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
148062,Australia,"An interesting mix is at work here: You get the Chardonnay body and pear flavors and some nuttiness from the 60% S??millon. Quite a straight-ahead wine, with more neutrality than nuance; the flavor profile ultimately veers toward citrus and almond. Overall it's forward and clean-tasting, with enough creaminess to satisfy.",,85,7,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,White Blend,McPherson Wine Company
148063,Australia,"This is a pretty good wine; fruity, spicy, ripe, round and supple, with classic green-apple and peach notes mingling with spicy, creamy, vanilla complexities. Interesting in that it uses Russian oak, with good results. Seems to have a little residual sugar, but high acidity balances things out.",,85,18,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Chardonnay,Warrabilla
148064,Australia,"Pulsating honey and pear aromas announce the sweetness that follows. Like many Aussie Chards, this is a huge mouthful of pineapple, banana and other tropical fruits. A touch of welcome bitterness offers some balance to the heavy finish.",,84,10,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Buckeley's
148071,Australia,"Wood and apple aromas open this wine, and the profile continues onto the palate. Fairly weighty in the mouth, but the body is almost all from the oak.

148072,Australia,"A little damp-smelling, with mushroom, mint and chocolate aromas, but not much fruit.

The fruit falls into the cranberry-and-cherry range.",,83,15,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heathfield Ridge

148078,Australia,"The nose is somewhat funky and earthy here, and doesn't show the lean fruit and herb elements the grape is capable of.

148227,Australia,"Opens deep and inky with prune, licorice, chocolate, Asian spices and a touch of leather. If you think that's a lot of nose for a $13 Shiraz, you're right.

Mineral and green grape flavors fade into fresh herbs on the palate, but the flavors are less than intense. Peach skin and grass aromas are joined by some rubber on the nose. Has potential; just wants to be dialed up a little louder.",Central Ranges,85,15,New South Wales,New South Wales,,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Simon Gilbert
149548,Australia,"Its aromas are quite niceÇ??clay, black cherry, eraser, graham cracker--but the palate doesn't deliver the goods quite as prettily. Has a papery/wooly feel; fruit has a green, sourish edge. Not imported to the U.S.",,84,17,New South Wales,Orange,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Climbing
149612,Australia,Offers perfumed floral/minerally notes on the nose. The palate deals citrus and dust flavors that aren't very detailed. A fine quaff. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.,Reserve,84,13,South Australia,South Australia,,Riesling,Jacob's Creek
149614,Australia,"Deep gold in color, with nut, peach and overt floral aromas. Bright and tropical on the palate, with a soft, almost oily feel; shows its alcohol on the finish. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",Bin 65,84,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Lindemans
149621,Australia,"Starts off with grassy, fresh herbal aromas and flavors of almond. After a second look, it's all lemon and grapefruit flavors, with an edge of sweetnessÇ??almost like a lemon tart. Slim in size, soft in feel. An easy quaff.",Zeepaard,84,10,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Sauvignon Blanc,West Cape Howe
149632,Australia,"Nut and white stone fruit aromas start things off. Tastes like pineapples and fresh cream; broad, but not so deep. Imported by Precept Brands.",,84,12,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Chardonnay,White Knot
149639,Australia,"Smooth in the mouth, this Chard starts off with citrus and dust aromas with a light edging of cake frosting. In the mouth, it's tauter and more austere than it usually is. Clean and not a vibrant wine, but that's a matter of preference. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",,84,8,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
150434,Australia,"Opens with ripe apple, honey and herb aromas, and opens to apple and peach flavors and an even, almost velvety texture. It's a stylish Chardonnay for everyday drinking.",Herzog Selection,85,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Teal Lake
150468,Australia,"There's nothing subtle about this intensely fruity wine. It's ripe black cherries all the way, with hints of chocolate and wintergreen. The tannins are soft, the acids low, but the flavors are so pretty that the lack of structure isn't a big issue in this everyday drinker.",,85,12,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Teal Lake
150562,Australia,"As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.",Grange,96,185,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150563,Australia,"Seamless luxury from stem to stern, this Ç??baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country. To be released 5/01.",RWT,95,70,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150570,Australia,"The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5Ç??8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.",Bin 707,93,90,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150571,Australia,"This big wine presents a sophisticated bouquet of toasty, leesy, nutty aromas. Fine depth of fruit and plenty of quality oak show here, with butterscotch, pear and apple flavors. Full-bodied and luscious, it shows the tremendous attention paid and importance assigned to this flagship white. The long, spicy finish sports complex lemon, leesy and mineral accents. To be released 5/01.",Yattarna,92,65,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Penfolds
150597,Australia,"Attractive blackberry aromas with bright tobacco and herb accents open this well-balanced wine. The palate shows strong cassis, earth and herb flavors, and an even mouthfeel. Finishes with dark cherry notes and full, fine tannins. This will age nicely and can use a little time. Quite flavorful and elegant.",Bin 407,90,19,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150607,Australia,"Comes on full and lush from the opening, with blackberry, chocolate, menthol and smoke aromas. In the mouth it delivers dark, dry flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak and has good acidity that keeps it from getting mushy. The solid finish offers more of the same, a nice spiciness and some substantial tannins. Drink now; should be even better in two years.",Bin 128,90,22,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150621,Australia,"Made for almost 40 yearsÇ??since 1962Ç??this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.",Bin 389,89,19,Australia Other,Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150634,Australia,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly richÇ??maybe even fat for RieslingÇ??but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.",Reserve,88,18,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Penfolds
150650,Australia,"This solid red has deep currant and toasty oak aromas. It opens to rich dark berry, plum and leather flavors with Asian spice accents. The mouthfeel is creamy, almost syrupy, and it shows some vanilla, spice, and a tart-sweetness on the finish.",Koonunga Hill,87,15,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150768,Australia,"Jacob's Creek's top-end red is complex, dense and supple. A seductive bouquet of cassis, Asian spice, leather, cocoa and smoke pulls you in and the palate delivers with a thick, velvety feel and concentrated black fruit. Dry, but ripe and even tannins on the long finish portend a good future for this already attractive wine. Cellar Selection.",Limited Release,92,50,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacob's Creek
150779,Australia,"The blackberry, vanilla and toasty oak elements are nicely balanced on the nose and in the mouth. Deep fruit shines, and the supple mouthfeel is very appealing. Finishes long, with a compelling back-end bouquet that completes the package in fine style.",Reserve,91,18,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Jacob's Creek
150786,Australia,"Nutty, toasty and tropical-fruit elements are nicely balanced in this wine's appealing bouquet. Subdued tropical-fruit flavors, mineral notes and a buttery, elegant mouthfeel with good acidity follow. The lengthy finish shows lingering, complex fruit flavors.",Limited Release,90,38,South Australia,Padthaway,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
150801,Australia,"This strongly-oaked wine has apple, lemon and toast aromas that open to a similar palate displaying pear elements and a buttery feel. Full on the nose and palate, this wine, 100% barrel fermented in French oak, finishes long with spicy notes.",Reserve,88,16,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
150810,Australia,"Deep cassis aromas, a touch of licorice, and menthol notes on the nose open to a palate of black-currant and cocoa flavors in this well-balanced, medium-weight wine. Nicely structured, it finishes with good length and moderate tannins; can be cellared a few years. Best Buy.",,88,11,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacob's Creek
150819,Australia,"This defines mainstream, affordable Chardonnay via its soft apple, pear and pineapple bouquet, pleasing mouthfeel and nice, lightly sweet blend of fruit, butter and spice elements on the palate and finish. Best Buy.",,87,10,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
150854,Australia,"The tangy grapefruit, lemon and pear notes on the nose carry over nicely to the palate. Subtle underlying tropical fruit adds dimension, the mouthfeel has a creamy texture (from the S??millon), and it finishes dry and clean.",,85,8,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Semillon-Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
